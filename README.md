## Roadmap
- Friends linked to friend role if appearing in Facebook friends
- Movie list: people in friends role should be able to vote for movies they want to see (to plan movie parties)
- Admins should be able to do some things on behalf of others (mark that someone wants to see a movie even if they don't have an account)
- Rent module: tenants should be able to place tickets
- Tom's visit site
- photo album
- blog
- downloads

Improve:
- get from env config: `TokenName:   "dwn-token"`
- Make sure certain keys (e.g. email) are not case sensitive
- document use of environmental variables
- when routing, first trim off base url (if base url isn't '/', then currently routing will be misaligned when split and break)
